check out the different branches, **especially the now new and cleaned up [patch-5](https://github.com/loneicewolf/linux-rootkits/tree/patch-5)** which is more clear and better. I didn't change nfhook on patch-5 but cleared up the other 2 rootkits.


#### NOTE THIS IS NO LONGER THE ORIGINAL ROOTKITS FROM nisay759/linux-rootkits  THESE ARE MODIFIED #

### Improved to work with kernel 5.x and some other contributions, e.g on fhide.


# Linux rootkits


This repo regroups my little precious collection of Linux 4.x kernel rootkits.

You will find some rootkits that I wrote and other publicly available rootkits that I adapted for the latest version of the Linux kernel.

These rootkits are by no mean real-world rootkits. They have been kept to the minimum and should be used for educational purposes only.

All these rootkits have been tested and are fully working on Linux versions 4.x.y

Visit my [blog](https://yassine.tioual.com/index.php/category/rootkit/) for more details.
